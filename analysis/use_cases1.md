# Use-cases of visualization 

## Adaptive radiation illustration from educational web site

This example is from University of California Museum of Paleontology's [Understanding Evolution](http://evolution.berkeley.edu). It illustrates 
* time scale with tick marks and values
   * units
   * zero point registered to tips
   * labels on the time scale (mesozoic, cenozoic)
* images at the tips
* a vertical bar representing a time interval 
   * a label on the bar
* extinct branches that terminate prior to the present
* variable thickness of branches (not explained)
